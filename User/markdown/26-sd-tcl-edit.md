Title: SD TCL - The edit Screen Editor
Subtitle: Microsoft Edit, a menu bar and a dozen keys — the one to reach for when you just want to change a record.

```
edit {dict} file record
nano {dict} file record
```

`edit` opens a record in **Microsoft Edit**, a small full-screen editor that
ships with Windows. It has a menu bar, the shortcuts everyone already knows,
and nothing else to learn. **That is the point of it**: if you want to fix a
line in a record and get on with your day, this is the one.

**`nano` is a second name for exactly this**, added for anyone arriving with
Linux or `nano` habits — same catalogued program, same editor, same keys.
There is no separate `nano` to learn.

It has no syntax highlighting and no command language. For SD BASIC source —
or for anything where you want highlighting, split windows, or a command bar —
use [micro](27-sd-tcl-micro.html) instead. For a session with no terminal, or
one you are driving from a script, use [ed](25-sd-tcl-ed.html).

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **The keys below are Microsoft Edit's own**, for the version SD ships —
> **1.2.1**. SD installs that editor and calls it; it does not implement it, so
> where a binding differs the editor is right.

## Both editors come with SD

**You do not install anything.** Both editors are in
`%USERPROFILE%\SDCoreSolo\usr\bin` — `edit.exe` is Microsoft Edit 1.2.1 and
`micro.exe` is micro 2.0.15 — and the installer needs nothing from the internet
to put them there.

## The keys

`Ctrl-S` saves and `Ctrl-Q` quits. Those two are most of what anyone needs.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`Ctrl-S`** | save |
| **`Ctrl-Q`** | exit |
| **`Ctrl-W`** | close the file |
| **`Ctrl-O`** · **`Ctrl-N`** | open a file · new file |
| **`Ctrl-Z`** · **`Ctrl-Y`** | undo · redo |
| **`Ctrl-X`** · **`Ctrl-C`** · **`Ctrl-V`** | cut · copy · paste |
| **`Ctrl-A`** | select all |
| **`Ctrl-F`** · **`Ctrl-R`** | find · replace |
| **`Ctrl-G`** | go to line:column |
| **`Ctrl-P`** | go to file |
| **`Alt-Z`** | toggle word wrap |

**The menu bar is the help.** There is no help screen — the Help menu holds
only *About* — and there does not need to be one: **`F10`** or **`Alt`** and the
menu's letter opens a menu, and every command is listed there **with its
shortcut printed beside it**.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`Alt-F`** | File |
| **`Alt-E`** | Edit |
| **`Alt-V`** | View |
| **`Alt-H`** | Help |

*Save As* is on the File menu and is the one common command with no shortcut of
its own: `Alt-F` then `A`.

## What SD does around the editor

The two screen editors are **one SD program with two names**, so everything in
this section is equally true of [micro](27-sd-tcl-micro.html).

| | |
|---|---|
| **the working copy** | the record is copied into `$hold` as *record*`.editing`, and the editor is run on that. It is removed on every exit, including the ones that fail |
| **saving** | *"Save? &lt;Y&gt;es, &lt;N&gt;o"*, then for a `bp` record *"Compile?"* and *"Catalogue?"* |
| **a `dict` record** | is always saved and re-compiled with `cd` |
| **finishing** | *"&lt;E&gt;xit or &lt;R&gt;e-edit"*, so a compile error can be fixed without starting again |

**A compiled dictionary record is truncated to its first 15 fields while you
edit it**, which is what you want: the fields after them are the compiled form,
and `cd` rebuilds them when you save.

## Marks, and how to type one

A **field** mark is a line break, so a text editor handles fields on its own.
The other three marks are single control characters an editor would either draw
as a stray glyph or drop, so each has a token you type instead.

**Every token is `~` and one more character, and `~` is the only escape
character.**

| | |
|---|---|
| `~~` | a value mark |
| `` ~` `` | a subvalue mark |
| `~!` | a text mark |
| `~-` | a literal `~`, where one would otherwise be misread |
| `~,` | a literal `,`, where one would otherwise read as a separator |

`SMITH~~JONES~~BROWN` is a three-value field; ``RED~`BLUE~~GREEN`` is two
values, the first with two subvalues.

### Marks in a row are separated by a comma

Written token against token a run of marks cannot be read, so SD puts a comma
between them. A text mark, a text mark and a value mark, one after another, is:

```
~!,~!,~~
```

**Type the comma yourself when you enter marks in a row.** It is a separator and
not data — which is why a literal comma standing in exactly that position,
between two marks, is written `~,`.

### The conversion is lossless

**No record is refused and none is mangled**, whatever it contains. A tilde is
written `~-` **only where the character after it would make the pair look like a
token** — another `~`, a backtick, a `!`, a `-`, a `,`, or a mark. Everywhere
else a tilde is left exactly as you wrote it, so `a~b` is still `a~b` and
ordinary source reads normally.

## Nothing to unlock, and one condition

**On Solo both editors run in your session with nothing to unlock** — no
`ADMIN`, no permission to be granted. An editor runs outside SD, as your
Windows user, and the operating system is yours already; see *Operating system
access* in the GettingStarted set. (The multiuser SD Core for Windows gates
them with a permission an administrator grants per account; there is no such
list on Solo.)

**The condition is a terminal.** A session with no terminal is refused before
anything is written — an API session, or a script driving SD down a pipe:

```
:edit bp zzed
edit needs a terminal to draw on, and this session has none.
ed, the line editor, works anywhere.
```

Both usage errors name the verb you typed rather than the program behind it:

```
:edit
No file name specified.  Usage: edit {dict} <file> <record>
:edit bp
No record name specified.  Usage: edit {dict} <file> <record>
```

## Who has these verbs

**Your account has `edit`, `micro` and `ed`**, and all three run with nothing
to unlock. `ed` also works with no terminal at all.
