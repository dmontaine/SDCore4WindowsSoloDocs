Title: SD Client API
Subtitle: The sdclilib client library, its functions across four language bindings, and the server status codes.

The SDClient API lets an external application connect to SD, open
files, read and write records, execute commands, call subroutines,
and manage select lists — all through a single shared library.

**The API is a normal way to use SD**, not a facility reserved for developers
and administrators. A person running a custom GUI program that talks to SD needs
the API switched on and the account password, and may need nothing else. On
Solo the API is on only if it was chosen at installation, or if the computer is
managed — see *API access* in the GettingStarted set.

## The library

Four DLLs are installed. They are built from one source: each pair is the same
code compiled twice under two output names, so the two files are not identical
on disk but behave identically.

| | |
|---|---|
| 64-bit | `sdclilib.dll` and `sdclient.dll` |
| 32-bit | `qmclilib.dll` and `qmclient.dll` |

The `*clilib` names are what existing applications ask for; the `*client` names
are for new work. **Renaming one to the other does not work**: an import library
records the DLL name its symbols come from, so an application built against
`sdclilib` loads `sdclilib.dll` whatever you call the file on disk. That is why
both names are built rather than one being a copy of the other.

> **The architecture must match the application, not the machine.** A 32-bit
> application on 64-bit Windows needs the 32-bit DLL. The 32-bit build is a
> shipping deliverable rather than a testing convenience.

### Where they are, and how to use them

```
%USERPROFILE%\SDCoreSolo\usr\clients\client64\     sdclilib.dll  sdclient.dll
%USERPROFILE%\SDCoreSolo\usr\clients\client32\     qmclilib.dll  qmclient.dll
```

Copy the DLL your application needs either **beside the application's own
executable** or into `C:\Windows\System32`. Those are the two supported routes
and either works.

> **`%USERPROFILE%\SDCoreSolo\usr\bin` is on your PATH**, because the installer
> adds it every time it runs — it is what makes `sd-solo` run from any directory.
> **All four client DLLs live in that directory too**, so an application may find
> one without your having copied anything. That is convenient, and it is not the
> same as choosing which copy it loads: PATH order decides, and a stale copy
> earlier on the PATH wins. **Put the DLL where your application will find it
> deliberately.**

`usr\clients` holds the DLLs **and one import library for each** — `.dll.a`
files, GNU-style, for linking rather than loading:

```
client64\     libsdclilib.dll.a  libsdclient.dll.a
client32\     libqmclilib.dll.a  libqmclient.dll.a
```

They sit beside the DLLs so that everything a client *build* needs is in one
place — apart from the header, which is elsewhere: **`sdclilib.h` is at
`%USERPROFILE%\SDCoreSolo\sdsys\syscom\sdclilib.h`**, with the Gambas and
PureBasic bindings, `sdclient.bas` and `sdclient.pb`, beside it.

**All four DLLs also appear in `%USERPROFILE%\SDCoreSolo\usr\bin`, beside
`sd-solo.exe`.** The 32-bit pair is there because `usr\bin` is on the PATH, and that
is where a **32-bit utility** finds its client. Those copies are SD's own and
are not the ones you should be taking. **The import libraries are deliberately
not in `usr\bin`**: a linker input has no business in a directory that goes on
the PATH.

## Connection

| | |
|---|---|
| `SDConnect(host, port, user, pass, account)` | over the network, to port **4249** (the default when you name none). The user and the account are both `sduser` |
| `SDConnectLocal(account)` | **disabled on Solo.** It signed in with no password, which Solo does not allow: it answers *SDConnectLocal is not available in SD Core Solo for Windows - connect with SDConnect and the account password* |

> `SDConnectUDS` (Unix Domain Socket) appears in the header but is not
> applicable on Windows. The Windows port supports TCP connections only.

**To reach SD from a program on the same computer, call `SDConnect` with
`127.0.0.1`.** The API has to be on; see *API access* in the GettingStarted set.

**The login is SCRAM-SHA-256, inside TLS 1.3.** A client that sends a password in
clear is refused. The server sets a puzzle only someone who knows the
password can answer, and the password itself is never sent in any
form. The server also proves itself to the client — another program
that grabbed the port before SD started cannot pretend to be SD. The password
is the account password — on a managed computer, the global password, which
the SD Core for Linux server uses.

A session is confined to its own account. An API session can open
everything inside its own account and the shipped SD system files every
account needs, but cannot open, rename, delete or list anything else.

## Server status codes

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SV_OK` | 0 | success |
| `SV_ON_ERROR` | 1 | an `ON ERROR` clause fired |
| `SV_ELSE` | 2 | an `ELSE` clause fired |
| `SV_ERROR` | 3 | an error occurred |
| `SV_LOCKED` | 4 | the record is locked by another session |
| `SV_PROMPT` | 5 | the command issued a prompt and is waiting for input |

## Language bindings

The API headers define bindings for four languages. The function
signatures are identical in meaning; the syntax differs. **The installation
carries the C header and the Gambas and PureBasic bindings**, in
`sdsys\syscom`; the others are in the source repository.

### Gambas3

```
Library "./sdclilib"
Extern SDConnect(Host As String, Port As Integer, UserName As String,
  Password As String, Account As String) As Boolean
Extern SDRead(FileNo As Integer, Id As String,
  ByRef Errno As Integer) As String
```

### PureBasic

```
PrototypeC.l P_SDConnect(host.p-utf8, port.l, user.p-utf8,
  pass.p-utf8, account.p-utf8)
PrototypeC.i P_SDRead(fno.l, id.p-utf8, *err)
```

Per-arity prototypes are provided for `SDCall` and `SDCallx`:
`P_SDCall0` through `P_SDCall20`, `P_SDCallx0` through `P_SDCallx20`.

### Free Pascal / Lazarus

```pascal
type
  TSDConnectFn = function(Host: PAnsiChar; Port: LongInt;
    User, Pass, Account: PAnsiChar): LongInt; cdecl;
  TSDReadFn = function(FileNo: LongInt; Id: PAnsiChar;
    Err: PLongInt): PAnsiChar; cdecl;
```

A `LoadSdCliLib` function loads the library and resolves all
function pointers; `UnloadSdCliLib` releases it.

### Python (ctypes)

```python
import ctypes
_lib = ctypes.CDLL('./sdclilib.dll')

SDConnect = _lib.SDConnect
SDConnect.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_int,
    ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_char_p]
SDConnect.restype = ctypes.c_int

SDRead = _lib.SDRead
SDRead.argtypes = [ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_char_p,
    ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int)]
SDRead.restype = ctypes.c_char_p
```

Per-arity `CFUNCTYPE` definitions are provided for `SDCall` and
`SDCallx` wrappers.

## What the API cannot do

| | |
|---|---|
| Open files outside the account | refused (status 3035 — *not permitted*) |
| Reach the credential file | never, and cannot be added |
| Write `global.bp.out` | refused, unless the session signed in with the global password |

**It can run `sh` and `OS.EXECUTE`.** An API session is you, on your ordinary
Windows token, with the rights of a session at the keyboard — see *API access*
in the GettingStarted set. That is different from the multiuser SD Core for
Windows, which refuses both over the API.

program outside SD reaching in.
