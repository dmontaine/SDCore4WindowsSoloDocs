Title: SDNet - Files on Another SD Server
Subtitle: Open a file that lives on another SD server and use it with READ, WRITE, SELECT and LIST; what the administrator turns on, and what stays off.

**Read this first.** SDNet lets a program open a file on **another SD server** through an
ordinary `OPEN` and then use it with the ordinary file statements. In SD Core Solo for Windows
it is **delivered off, in four places**: the account has no NET gate, no server is defined,
nobody has a login on one, and no VOC entry points at one. The administrator turns each on,
deliberately, and each can be turned off again. **On Windows the client is compiled and the checks
that need no installed system pass; it has not yet been run against another server.** The Linux
version of this client was run in private test sandboxes; that is not a result for this one.

Solo is a **client** of SDNet here, and it is also a **target**:

| | |
|---|---|
| Solo reaches a server (**Solo to Core**, **Solo to Solo**) | **limited**: a program may read, select and query the remote files; and, **only for a server the administrator defined `write`**, write, delete and lock. Nothing else crosses: no commands, no programs, no operating system paths. |
| A SD Core server reaches Solo | through Solo's API login, as any API client does; see *API access* in the GettingStarted set for what that login gives and for API request 29. |

Commands are shown here in lower case. *Italics* mark something you supply.

## What has to be true before a program can open a remote file

All of these, checked in this order, before anything is dialled:

1. **The account has the NET gate.** `set.net.access on` (the administrator, after `admin`).
   The gate is **off as delivered** and a blank or missing field is off. It is the same gate
   that lets an API client open a file here with request 29.
2. **A server is defined** with `set.server`, by the administrator, and the account is named
   in the definition's accounts list (Solo has one account, `sduser`, so that is `accounts sduser`).
3. **There is a stored login** for that server: `set.netlogin`.
4. **The key the server presents is the one the definition pins.** A server that presents
   another key is sent nothing at all.
5. **A VOC entry names the file**: a record whose field 1 is `N`, field 2 the server's name and
   field 3 the file's name on that server. The administrator writes it (it is a VOC record).

The administrator is exempt from the gate and from the accounts list. Every other check applies to it.

## Defining a server: `set.server`, `list.servers`, `delete.server`

```
set.server name host port account {pin | connect} {read | write} {accounts a,b,c} {no.query}
list.servers {name}
delete.server name
```

The three are the administrator's: each stops with "Command requires administrator privileges"
for anyone else. A definition is one line of a file, `netservers`, in the SD system folder:
the name, the host, the port, the account to enter on the remote server, the hash of the
server's public key (the *pin*), the mode, the accounts that may use it and the date. **The file
never holds a secret**, and it is readable by whoever can read that folder.

| field | rule |
|---|---|
| `name` | a lower case letter, then up to 15 lower case letters or digits (upper case is converted) |
| `host` | a DNS name, an IPv4 address or an IPv6 literal; no one but the administrator ever chooses a host |
| `port` | 1 to 65535, the port of the other server's API: **4247** for SD Core, **4249** for a Solo |
| `account` | the account to enter on the remote server (1 to 32 letters, digits, `.` `_` `-`) |
| pin | exactly 64 hexadecimal digits, **or the word `connect`** (below) |
| `read` / `write` | what a program may do with the server's files. `read` unless you say `write` |
| `accounts` | the accounts here that may use the server. **Left out, none may**: the definition says so when it is made |

A definition that is wrong is refused with a message of its own for each field, and nothing is
written. At most ten servers can be defined. Replacing a name asks first; `no.query` skips that
question and **never the key question below**.

**The pin is the hash of the server's public key** (its SubjectPublicKeyInfo), not of its
certificate, so a certificate renewed over the same key keeps it. Two ways to get it:

- **Typed**: the 64 digits the other server's administrator gives you. Nothing is dialled.
- **`connect`**: every other field is checked first; then one TLS connection is made to *host:port*
  (it waits `NETWAIT` seconds), the hash of the key the server presents is **shown on a line of
  its own**, and you are asked `Trust this key (y/<n>)?`. Only `y` writes the definition. The
  connection is a handshake and sends nothing. **Compare the hash by a way that does not use
  this network**: if it differs, something may be standing between you and that server.

On a Solo server the hash is the `public key sha256:` line that `settings.report` prints in its
`[api]` section; on a SD Core for Windows server it is the same line.

Each of the three verbs writes a line in the audit trail (`set.server name=...`, `delete.server name=...`),
which never carries the pin.

## Your login on a server: `set.netlogin` and `delete.netlogin`

```
set.netlogin server
delete.netlogin server
```

`set.netlogin` asks for the **user name and the password you have on the remote server** (the
password is typed hidden), runs the SCRAM-SHA-256 exchange with that server once, and keeps **the values
derived from the password**: the salt and the iteration count the server gave, the *ClientKey* and
the *ServerKey*. That is enough to log in later and not enough to learn the password or try it
anywhere else. **The password is never stored, printed, logged, audited or written**; it is held in one
variable and spent on the derivation.

- It needs the NET gate **and** the account named in the server's list, or the administrator.
  (SD Core for Windows refuses the administrator here for want of a Windows sign-in of its own to keep a
  login under. In Solo the administrator is the same Windows user as the account, so it keeps a login too.)
- **Where it is kept**: one file for each server in the folder `netlogins` in the SD system folder. The
  folder is made the first time it is needed and takes the access list of your own tree, which admits you,
  SYSTEM and Administrators and nobody else. It is outside every account's folder, so a
  program whose **OS switch is off** cannot reach it with `openseq`. **Every use is preceded by a test
  that the file is a plain file, not a link, owned by you, with an access list that admits nobody but you,
  SYSTEM and Administrators, in a folder that passes the same test.** A file that fails the test is refused and
  nothing in it is used.
- **The honest limit.** A session that holds the `os` switch (or the `sh` switch) can read anything the Windows
  user can read, this folder included, exactly as it can read your `.ssh` folder; so can an administrator of
  the computer. Leave the switches off on an account that does not need them.
- **The key is checked first.** The key the server presents is compared with the definition's pin **before a
  single byte is sent**; a different key ends the command with nothing sent, and a login made for another key is
  refused when it is used.
- On any failure nothing is written and an existing login is untouched.

`delete.netlogin` removes it. Both write an audit line (`set.netlogin server=... remote=...`,
`delete.netlogin server=...`), with no password, key or hash in it.

## The VOC pointer

```
N
nfa
customers
```

A VOC record with `N` in field 1, the server's name in field 2 and the file's name on that server in field 3
(lower case; up to 63 letters, digits and `. _ - $`). Opening it, `open 'customers' to f`, gives a file variable
that these statements work on: `read`, `matread`, `readv`, `select`, `selectv`, `sselect`, `readnext`,
`fileinfo` (type 7), `close`, and `getlocks()`. `open 'dict', 'customers' to d` opens the dictionary of the remote
file from the same server, so `list`, `count`, `sort`, `select`, `list.item` and `list dict` work on the VOC name.
A `select` takes every record id of the remote file in one reply; each record a query then needs is one request, so
a query that reads every record of a big file costs one round trip per record.

**A pointer someone wrote for themselves gives them nothing they were not granted**: the gate, the list, the login
and the pin are asked every time, **an `$internal` program included**.

## Writing and locking: a server defined `write`

For a server defined `write`, a file opened through it also takes `write`, `writeu`, `matwrite`, `writev`,
`writevu`, `delete`, `deleteu`, `clearfile`, `readu` and the other locking reads, `recordlocku`, `recordlockl`,
`release`, `filelock` and `fileunlock`, and `recordlocked()` asks the server. A lock is the **server's**: it is held
there, for this session, and `release` or a `close` or the end of the process gives it up. A statement that changes
or locks a file of a server defined `read` is refused with message 12506 (or sets `status()` under `on error`) and
**nothing is sent**.

**`recordlocked(f, id)` needs the same two things as a lock**: the server must be defined `write` here, and the login
on the other machine must be allowed to ask. A `read` definition stops the program with message 12506
(`recordlocked is refused`) and nothing is sent; the function has no `on error` clause, so a refusal always stops the
program. A SD Core server answers request 34, the one `recordlocked()` sends, only to a login that is in its write
group; to any other it replies with an error, and the program stops with message 12505 and that machine's words, which
end `(request 34)`. The answer names the holder of the lock by his user number on the other machine, which is why a
login that can only read is not given it. Inside `begin transaction` it still works for a `write` definition, because it
changes nothing. `getlocks()` of a remote file is the local view only.

- The mode is the **client's** setting, set only by the administrator. The server it points at is not told: **what the
  login may do there is that server's decision**. A SD Core server's files-only route lets a login write only if the
  administrator of that server has put the remote user in its write group, and refuses the change otherwise; the refusal
  comes back as an `on error` reply with the server's own text.
- A change is **never repeated** and **never made inside a transaction**: `begin transaction` with a change to a remote file
  stops with 12515. A connection that is lost *after* a change was sent says so (12514) and does not say whether the
  change was made: read the record to find out.
- A `read` can be up to **2 seconds old**: the process keeps the last 64 records it read from remote files for 2 seconds.
  A record over 32,768 bytes is not kept; `readv` is not cached; a write-mode handle is never cached.
- **Solo does not ask an "edit" question** (SD Core asks one for a remote file whose *name* says it is a VOC, a dictionary
  or a program file): Solo has no edit gates, so for such a name the other server's own gates decide.

## The two waits: `NETWAIT` and `NETREPLY`

Two `sd.conf` parameters, in seconds, 1 to 3600 (zero is refused): **`NETWAIT`** (5 unless you say otherwise) is how
long to wait for a connection to a remote server, **`NETREPLY`** (30) how long to wait for each reply to a request. `config('NETWAIT')`
and `config('NETREPLY')` read them.

**A server that goes silent is given up on at those times.** `NETWAIT` bounds the TCP connection and then the TLS
handshake, each: a server that accepts the connection and never answers the hello is given up on after `NETWAIT`, not
after 15 seconds fixed. `NETREPLY` bounds each read, including the first reply of the login after the handshake. A TLS 1.3
server sends its session tickets after the handshake, and a server or a link can stop in the middle of a TLS record;
neither uses up the wait or lets the read run on without a limit. A reply that stops in the middle of its body is a lost
connection, like a reply that never starts: message 12502 for a read, 12514 for a change (whose outcome is then unknown),
and the connection is dropped. A server that answers late but inside `NETREPLY` is read as before. The limit is for each
read, not for a whole reply: a server that sends one byte at a time and never stops is still waited for one read at a time.

`OPEN.SOCKET` takes the same number as its fourth argument (seconds to wait for the connection, zero for no limit of SD's
own); every SDNet caller passes `NETWAIT`.

## What is audited

| line | when |
|---|---|
| `set.server name=... host=... port=... mode=... replaced=... pin=typed|confirmed` | a definition is made or replaced |
| `delete.server name=... host=... port=...` | a definition is removed |
| `set.netlogin server=... remote=...` | a login is stored |
| `delete.netlogin server=...` | a login is removed |
| `netfile open server=... file=...` (and `mode=write`) | a remote file is opened, once |
| `netfile refused server=... reason=...` | an open is refused, with the reason (gate, list, login, pin, limit) |
| `netfile clear server=... file=...` | a `clearfile` of a remote file |

No password, key, hash, record id or record is ever audited.

## What is not here

- **No files-only route on a Solo server.** SD Core has one (the Windows groups `sdfiles` and `sdfileswrite`); Solo has one
  account and one Windows user, and its API login is the account's own login. API request 29 is behind the NET gate and
  `NETFILES` bit 2, as the Getting Started set explains.
- **A remote file does not follow you across an account change**: the process's connections are dropped when the account
  is entered again (the NET gate is set), so a remote file variable from before is stale.
- Select by index, and a server's own indices, are not used for a remote file. Creating, configuring, indexing or deleting
  a remote file, `FCONTROL` of one and `WRITE ... CREATING.SEQKEY` are not here.
- **Not run on Windows yet.** The paths above are compiled and the checks that need no installed system pass. The
  test of a stored login's access list was run against real Windows access lists (your own file passes; one that admits
  Everyone or another group, a junction, the wrong kind of object, a missing path and a file someone else owns are refused).
  Nothing has been run between this Solo and another server.
