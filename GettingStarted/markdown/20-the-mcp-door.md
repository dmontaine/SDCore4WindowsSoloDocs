Title: The MCP Door
Subtitle: Letting an AI agent's MCP client use your SD account through four read-only tools, and one more if you allow it - two switches, both off, and what a door like this does and does not add.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is how an AI agent - Claude Code, an IDE's assistant, any program that speaks it - is given tools. SD Core Solo for Windows can offer such a client a small set of tools that use **your own account**: look at the files, read a record, list some records, and, only if you allow it, run a sentence. This page is for the administrator (`admin` first). It says what is offered, what the two switches do, what is written down about every call, and what the door is not.

> **Nothing is on as delivered.** Both switches are off. Until the administrator runs `set.mcp on`, the launcher answers an agent's first message with an error that says so, and a request written by hand is refused inside SD as well.

## What the door is

The door is a small Python program, `solo-mcp.py`, that is part of the installation (in the SD Core Solo folder, `%USERPROFILE%\SDCoreSolo`, beside the other helper scripts). **Nothing runs it until an MCP client starts it** as a child process; it has no port, no network connection, no service and no scheduled task. It talks to the client in JSON lines on its standard input and output, and for each call it runs one `sd-solo mcp.call ...` command in your account, with no window. **Every decision is made inside SD**, by the program `mcp.call`: whether the door is open, whether a word is allowed, the work itself, and the line in the audit trail. A client that did not use `solo-mcp.py` would meet the same gate.

**It needs Python 3**, which is not part of SD Core Solo: install it from python.org (the `py` launcher comes with it). Print the snippet an MCP client needs with:

```
py -3 %USERPROFILE%\SDCoreSolo\solo-mcp.py --config
```

It shows the command and its full path in the form MCP clients read (`mcpServers`). With Claude Code the same thing is `claude mcp add sd-solo -- py -3 <that path>`.

## The two switches

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `set.mcp` | Says whether the door is open and whether the write tool is. Changes nothing. |
| `set.mcp on` / `set.mcp off` | Opens or shuts the door. With it shut, no tool works. |
| `set.mcp write on` / `set.mcp write off` | Gives the agent `sd_run`, or takes it back. |

`set.mcp` is an administrator command (`admin` first), and each command changes one thing. **Both are read at every call**, so `set.mcp off` stops an agent that is already working at its next call. The change is written to the audit trail (`set.mcp on account=sduser`).

## The tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sd_files` | Lists the files of the account. |
| `sd_describe` | Lists the dictionary items - the fields - of one file. |
| `sd_read` | Reads one record: a field to a line, value marks shown as `]`. |
| `sd_query` | Lists records: the fields to show, conditions (`=`, `#`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` and a plain value), one sort field, a limit of at most 200 rows. |
| `sd_run` | Runs ONE sentence as you could type it. **Only with `set.mcp write on`.** |

The first four are marked read-only for the client. **`sd_query` does not take a sentence.** The client gives names and values, and SD builds the `list` itself after checking that every field, condition field and sort field is an item of that file's dictionary; a keyword such as `lptr` is not an item, a value may hold only plain characters, and no quote reaches the query processor. `sd_run` is marked destructive, so a client can ask you before it runs.

**No tool can change a setting of SD or reach the administrator.** `sd_run` runs in the account's own session, so the account's own switches apply: while `sh` and `os.execute` are off (as delivered), `sh` and the commands that leave the account are refused through the door as they are at your prompt. See [Operating system access](06b-operating-system-access.html).

## What is written down

Every call - refused ones too - is one line in the audit trail:

```
mcp call agent=claude-code tool=read target=customers c1 status=ok
```

`agent` is the name the client gave when it connected, cut to lower case letters, digits, dot, underscore and hyphen and 32 characters; the user is still you. `status` is `ok`, `refused` (the door or the write tool is shut, or a word is not allowed) or `error` (a file or record that is not there, a request that is not valid). For `sd_run` the target is the sentence.

## Limits

One call at a time; at most 30 seconds; an answer is cut at 64 KB (and says `[output cut]`); control characters other than a new line and a tab are turned into spaces, so a terminal escape inside a record cannot reach the agent as text; a message of more than 1 MB is refused.

## How it signs in, and what that means

A one-shot `sd-solo` command never asks for a password. It uses the account password that the installation **keeps** for exactly this (see [Scheduled jobs](04-scheduled-jobs.html)), and it proves the account password only - never the administrator's. The launcher itself holds, reads and passes no password. If no password is kept, the launcher says so and the door stays shut; `set.mcp on` tells you when that is the case.

## What the door does not add

Be clear about this before you open it. **An agent that can run commands as you can already run the same one-shot command itself**: the kept password is protected for your Windows user, so any program that runs as you can use it. The two switches and the read-only tools are therefore the rules of *this* door and a record for you of what came through it; they are not a wall against an agent that also has a shell.

What the door adds is structure (a tool call instead of free text), a narrow read-only default, the agent's name in every audit line, your client's own permission questions, and a switch that is off until you turn it on. Decide what you hand an agent as you would decide what you hand any program that runs as you.

## Turning it off again

`set.mcp off` shuts the door at once. Removing the MCP client's configuration stops the client starting the launcher; the launcher is a file, and nothing else in the installation depends on it.
